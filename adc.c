    Essentially the ADC uses an OP-AMP to read inputs
    Positive Terminal is for our reading in value
    Negative Terminal is our reference for LOW or 0
    
    In our design we are reading from 2 sensors, tension and compression sensor
    
    TSENSE or Tension sensor is on AN3
    CSENSE or Compression sensor is on AN2
    
    BOTH Negative Inputs for MUX A and B are VREFL - Voltage Reference LOW

    Positive Reference for MUX B - AN3 / TSENSE

    The order is initially at A, then swaps to B, then back to A, and repeat
